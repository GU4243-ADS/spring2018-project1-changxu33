#Section 2:Read in the data

The following code assumes that the dataset `spooky.csv` lives in a `data` folder (and that we are inside a `doc` folder).

## Step 1: Using spooky 

```{r}
spooky<-read.csv('../data/spooky.csv',as.is=T)
```

### An overview of the data structure and content

Let's first remind ourselves of the structure of the data.
```{r}
dim<-dim(spooky)
dim
head(spooky)
summary(spooky)
sum(is.na(spooky))
spooky$author<-as.factor(spooky$author)
unique(spooky$author)
```
